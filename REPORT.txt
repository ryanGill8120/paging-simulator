(1) Did this one solo

(2) The video posted was very helpful. My outputs for part1 match what was discussed there. 
    Both of my output files match the size of the input files, as expected.
    Dr. Silvestro mentioned a page fault value x, 3000 < x < 3500 for part 2. My page fault value is in this range.

(3) I hope that my hashes match! I was not sure how to explicitly hash binary files 

(4) I enjoyed working on the LRU/page replacement algorithms. I did not have time to finish the extra credit, but
    this would be a great project to work on after the due date (I will implement EC and possibly try to make this
    something that can be seen visually by the user.)
